Retrospector is a Eurorack format stereo digital delay. 

Delay times can be set clocked or free-running and left and right channels can be independent or the right channel set as a multiple of the left channel. The delay times are switchable between short, long and reversed with maximum delay times over 5 minutes.

The feedback path can be filtered with settings allowing a sweep from low pass to high pass, or either separately. The delayed signal can be modulated for subtle chorussing effects or left and right channels fed back into each other to widen dual mono sources.

The feedback control allows greater than 100% regeneration allowing the delay to increase the volume of the delayed signal.
